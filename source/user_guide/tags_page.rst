Tags
====

Tags is one of the main concept of Moira.

Each trigger must contain at least one tag. That means you can not save trigger without tag.

Each subscription must contain at least one tag.

You can use tag for projects, user groups, severity of alert or any other way that you find.

That is why any tag should be deleted very carefully.

For this purpose there is special hidden page /#/tags/. That means you need type it in browser address bar.

Tags list shows how many triggers and subscriptions use current tag.

You can not delete tag until zero triggers count. But you can delete tag regardless it usage in subscriptions.

Also you can delete subscription of any user for current tag from this page.
